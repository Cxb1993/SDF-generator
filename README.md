# SDF-generator
Creates a signed distance function for a closed surface using the algebraic point set surface method, for use as an initial condition in fluid dynamics simulations. This code is a very quick proof-of-concept for this application of the APSS method, and is not robust for badly-sampled or open surfaces.
